# Overview

Design overview of the S multi-LST pool.

## Key Concepts

### SOL Value

Since we're dealing exclusively with LSTs, all accounting and calculations are done in SOL terms. 

The SOL value of a LST can be though of as "how much unstaked SOL will I get in the next epoch if I redeem and deactivate the LST right now". This therefore includes the stake pool's withdrawal fees at that instant.
